        <h2>Homemade Flatbread Pizza Recipe</h2>
        <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-flatbread-pizza-recipe/">Original Recipe</a>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry or <strong>instant yeast</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
            <li>3/4 cup (180ml) warm <strong>water</strong></li>
            <li>2 cups (250g) <strong>all-purpose flour</strong> or <strong>bread flour</strong></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) <strong>olive oil</strong>, plus 2 teaspoons for brushing the dough</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> Whisk the yeast, sugar, and warm water together in the bowl of your stand mixer. Loosely cover and allow to sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy and frothy on top.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, olive oil, and salt (and garlic/seasoning if using). Mix on low speed with the dough hook attachment until combined, about 2 minutes. </li>
            <li><strong>Knead the dough:</strong> Keep the dough in the mixer and beat with the dough hook on low speed for an additional 6–8 minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 6–8 minutes. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap, aluminum foil, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to sit and rest for 45 minutes at room temperature. Once it has rested and slightly risen, you can continue with the recipe or place the covered dough in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. More instructions in the make ahead Note below.</li>
            <li>As the dough is resting and rising, prepare your toppings. See blog post and/or recipe note below.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Punch the dough down to release any air. Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface with floured hands and working with one dough piece at a time, begin shaping and stretching the dough until it is 1/4 inch thick. You can use a floured rolling pin for this too. Repeat with the second piece of dough. Carefully transfer both pieces of dough to a parchment paper or silicone-mat lined baking sheet, or use a pizza stone. </li>
            <li>Poke your fingers all around the surface of the flatbreads or prick a few holes with a fork. Drizzle or brush each with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Top each with your favorite toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15–20 minutes or until the crust and toppings are browned to your liking. Remove from the oven. Slice and serve warm.</li>
            <li>Cover and store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>

            <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/dolly-parton-cinnamon-bread-review-7968033">SimplyRecipes</a> <br>
            <span>The website clearly displays instructions and ingredients in a clean format. It includes photos but they don't take up the entire page.</span><br><br>
            <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/shrimp-green-sauce">Bon Appetit</a> <br>
            <span>This website has a very clean aesthetic and clear headers to seperate sections. It also uses bolding in the instructions to help guide readers to the important ingredient instructions.</span><br><br>
            <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/southern-fried-pork-chops/">Taste of Home</a> <br>
            <span>This site also uses bolding and font size to divide sections clearly. I like how the main headline of each step is bolded and bigger than the smaller, more in-depth instructions. It helps guide readers and give them a general idea of what the recipe requires without having to read everything.</span>

            <span>I think I want to use a sans-serif font for my website and I think AIGA does a great job using this type of typeface. I also like how in articles, the website uses a different color for pull quotes/emphasis.</span><br><br>
            <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/website-design">Squarespace</a><br>
            <span>I think Squarespace does a good job of balancing using images and text on their home page. I also think the website has a really nice typographic hierarchy</span><br><br>
            <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a><br>
            <span>I think Mailchimp does a good job of using a simple color palette. I also think this site does a good job of dividing the content on its pages into a clear grid system.</span>
