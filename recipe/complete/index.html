            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon active <strong>dry or instant yeast</strong></li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
                <li>3/4 cup (180ml)<strong>warm water</strong></li>
                <li>2 cups (250g) <strong>all-purpose flour or bread flour</strong></li>
                <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) <strong>olive oil</strong>, plus 2 teaspoons for brushing the dough</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> Whisk the yeast, sugar, and warm water together in the bowl of your stand mixer. Loosely cover and allow to sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy and frothy on top.</li>
                <li>Add the <strong>flour, olive oil, and salt</strong> (and garlic/seasoning if using). Mix on low speed with the dough hook attachment until combined, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <img src="pizza_3.jpeg" id="instructionsImage"> 
                <li><strong>Knead the dough:</strong> Keep the dough in the mixer and beat with the dough hook on low speed for an additional 6–8 minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 6–8 minutes. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.</li>
                <li><strong>Place the dough in a greased bowl</strong> and cover with plastic wrap, aluminum foil, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to sit and <strong>rest for 45 minutes</strong> at room temperature. Once it has rested and slightly risen, you can continue with the recipe or place the covered dough in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</li>
                <li>As the dough is resting and rising, prepare your toppings.</li>
                <img src="pizza_4.jpeg" id="fullSpanImage"> 
                <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Punch the dough down to release any air. Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface with floured hands and working with one dough piece at a time, begin shaping and stretching the dough until it is 1/4 inch thick. You can use a floured rolling pin for this too. Repeat with the second piece of dough. Carefully transfer both pieces of dough to a parchment paper or silicone-mat lined baking sheet, or use a pizza stone.</li>

                <li>Poke your fingers all around the surface of the flatbreads or prick a few holes with a fork. Drizzle or brush each with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Top each with your favorite toppings.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake for 15–20 minutes</strong> or until the crust and toppings are browned to your liking. Remove from the oven. Slice and serve warm.</li>
                <li>Cover and store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
