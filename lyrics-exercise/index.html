        <h1>
            on the sea<br> 
            beach house <br>
            from the album "bloom" <br>
            2012
        </h1>
        <p>
            [verse 1]<br>
            Out on the sea we'd be forgiven <br>
            Our bodies stopped the spirit leaving <br>
            Wouldn't you like to know how far you've got left to go<br> <br>

            [verse 2]<br>
            Somebody's child<br>
            Nobody made you<br>
            It's not what you stole, it's what they gave you<br>
            In or out, you go<br>
            In your silence, your soul<br><br>

            [verse 3]<br>
            Would you rather go unwilling?<br>
            The heart is full and now it's spilling<br>
            Barreling down the steps<br>
            Only a moment left<br><br>

            [chorus]<br>
            In hind of sight no peace of mind<br>
            Where you begin and I'm defined<br>
            Daughter of unconscious fate<br>
            Time will tell, in spite of me<br><br>
            In hind of sight no peace of mind<br>
            Where it begins and we'll be fine<br>
            Shadows bend and suddenly<br>
            The world becomes<br>
            And swallows me in, me in<br><br>

            [outro]<br>
            Whistle to a friend<br>
            Gentle 'til the end<br>
            Any way in a name<br>
            She takes shape just the same<br><br>
        </p>
