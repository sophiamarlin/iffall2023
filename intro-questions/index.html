        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <ol> 
            <li><b>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b></li>
            <p>My name is Sophia Marlin. My major is Communciation Design and I am a Junior.</p> <br>
            <li><b>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b></li> 
            <p>I am a graphic designer and have prototyped websites through Figma before. I wanted to learn a bit more about the coding that goes into this design process.</p> <br>
            <li><b>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b></li>
            <p>I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS as I took a Rapid Prototype Development class last semester. However, it didn't focus very heavily on design.</p> <br>
            <li><b>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b></li>
            <p>One thing I want to learn is how to be creative with composition despite the blocky visual format of html.</p> <br>
            <li><b>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b></li>
            <p>One major difference is how the design will be viewed. If it's on a screen it will probably be very close to the readers face while a printed design on something like a poster must be visible from a distance.</p> <br>
            <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b></li>
            <p><a href="https://spotify.design/">Spotify Design-</a> I think this website has a great visual hierarchy and uses colorful interactions to guide the user.</p> <br>
            <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b></li>
            <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times-</a> The line divisions between article descriptions and the change in size/boldness in the text helps to communicate the different stories to the viewer. Also, the simple navigation bar at the top with different categories also clearly communicates to a user what their options are.</p> <br>
            <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></li>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon-</a> I think the Amazon website works very well. It is designed to direct users to products, through the navigation bar at the top of the page, the search bar, and the modules in the body of the page which display reccommended products. The usage of image-focused elements in the body is a good choice since it visually shows users products.</p> <br>
